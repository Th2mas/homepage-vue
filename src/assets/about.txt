Since I can remember I was always interested in the IT field, starting with games and webpages.
 Attending the World Expo 2017 in Astana led me to becoming a big advocate for Renewable Energies.
 Therefore, I started my second studies in Electrical Engineering, wanting to work in this field and combine both
    interests, energy production / management and the IT world.
 Becoming a member of the TU Wien Space Team has shown me, that it is possible to combine many of my interests.
 I love reading and watching new stuff regarding IT, modern technology, renewables, aquaponics and modern food
    production (e.g. vertical farming).
